ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: No JSON object could be decoded


Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  did not find expected '-' indicator

The error appears to be in '/docker/ansible/nginx/yaml/nginx_sync.yml': line 54, column 5, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.


The offending line appears to be:

   - { src: "{{ local_jsh_src }}/html/" , dest: "{{ remote_dest }}/html/" }
    - conf

    ^ here
