PUPPET_COMMAND_START
 [WARNING]: Invalid characters were found in group names but not replaced, use
-vvvv to see details
ERROR! The field 'hosts' has an invalid value, which includes an undefined variable. The error was: 'pupm' is undefined

The error appears to be in '/ansible/puppet/puppet.yml': line 2, column 6, but may

be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

---

   - hosts: "{{ pupm }}"
     ^ here
We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with
missing quotes. Always quote template expression brackets when they
start a value. For instance:


    with_items:
      - {{ foo }}

Should be written as:


    with_items:
      - "{{ foo }}"
